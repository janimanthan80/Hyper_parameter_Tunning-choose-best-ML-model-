How to choose the best model for a Data Science project?

To find a prediction of specific data, we need the perfect machine learning model that will give us the best accuracy in our datasets. But the question is: How do you choose the right machine learning model? There are several machine learning models that produce different results on different datasets.

so to choose the right dataset there is one technique called 'HYPER_PARAMETER_TUNNING' which allows you to choose the right machine learning model, and here in my code I explained how to find the right model and which model should best fit our data Scientific project

So check my code and use it, use it in your project and find the correct result of the specific problem.
