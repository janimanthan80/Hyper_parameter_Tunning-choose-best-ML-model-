How to select best model for Data science project?

So in order to Find prediction of a certain Data, We need a perfect Machine learning Model which can give us the best accuracy in our Datasets. But the question is, How to choose a right Machine learning model there are several machine learning model which gives different results in different datasets. 

so In order to select right dataset there is one technique called 'HYPER_PARAMETER_TUNNING',which allows use to select right Machine learning model and Here In my code I have explained how to find the right model and and which model should be best fit for our Data Science project,

So please check out my code and use it use it into your project and find the right result of a certain problem.
